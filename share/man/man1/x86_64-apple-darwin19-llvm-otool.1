llvm-otool \- the otool-compatible command line parser for llvm-objdump
.\" SYNOPSIS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B llvm-otool
[
.I "option \&..."
] [
.I "file \&..."
]
.\" DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command line shim
.I llvm-otool
takes all the same options as the original
.IR otool (1)
command and executes an equivalent
.IR objdump (1)
command.  Its use is to ease the change over
of the original use of
.IR otool (1)
to the llvm based open source
.IR objdump (1)
command with the similar functionality.
.PP
The original implementation of
.IR otool (1)
can now be found as
.IR otool-classic (1)
and typically will be run by using "xcrun otool-classic".
.TP
.B \-show-objdump-command
Print the
.IR objdump (1)
command that
.IR llvm-otool (1)
will execute.
.\" "NOTES FOR SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.SH "NOTES FOR SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-l
This always implies the
.B \-h
option, as the
.IR objdump (1)
option
.B \-private-headers
prints both the mach header and load commands.
.TP
.B \-S
To display the contents of the `\_\^\_.SYMDEF' archive file, use
.IR llvm-nm (1)
with the
.B \-print-armap
option.
.\" "GENERAL NOTES"
.SH "GENERAL NOTES"
Many of the older options in
.IR otool(1)
are obsolete as they print parts of the object file that are no longer in use.
When used with
.IR llvm-otool (1)
a line is printed that states the option and the functionality is obsolete.  If
no valid equivalent options are given then usage message from
.IR objdump (1)
will be printed when executed.
.PP
The archive member syntax of arguments of the form
.IR "libx.a(foo.o)" ,
is not supported.  Which is the same as if the
.B \-m
option is always used.
.PP
When doing disassembly the default is to not print the opcode bytes of the
instructions even for 32-bit ARM.  To get the opcode bytes printed for ARM
the
.IR otool (1)
option
.B \-j
needs to be used.
.PP
There are some white space differences in the output of the
.IR otool (1)
and
.IR objdump (1)
commands in some cases.  As the
.IR objdump (1)
command is not meant to produce the exact same output as
.IR otool (1)
in all cases where the functionality is very similar.
.\" "SPECIFIC TRANSLATIONS OF OPTIONS"
.SH "SPECIFIC TRANSLATIONS OF OPTIONS"
Below is the list of
.IR otool (1)
options and the specific
.IR objdump (1)
option to print the same information.
To use these options with
.IR objdump (1)
the
.B \-macho
option must be used.
The default for
.IR objdump (1)
is as if the verbose,
.B \-v
option is always used.  To get the non-verbose output the
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-non-verbose
option is used.
.TP
.B \-a
The
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-archive-headers
will print the archive header, if the file is an archive.  To get the offsets
to the archive headers that would be printed with the
.IR otool (1)
.B \-aV
options, the
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-archive-member-offsets
can be added.
.TP
.B \-S
There is no
.IR objdump (1)
option to display  the contents of the `\_\^\_.SYMDEF' file, if the file is an
archive.  For that use
.IR llvm-nm (1)
with the
.B \-print-armap
option.
.TP
.B \-f
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the universal headers is
.BR \-universal-headers .
.TP
.B \-h
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the Mach header is
.BR \-private-header .
.TP
.B \-l
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the load commands is
.B \-private-headers
which also always displays the Mach header.
.TP
.B \-L
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the names and version numbers of the shared libraries that
the object file uses, as well as the shared library ID if the file is a shared
library is
.BR \-dylibs-used .
.TP
.B \-D
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display just the install name of a shared library is
.BR \-dylib-id .
.TP
.BI \-s " segname sectname"
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the contents of the section
.RI ( segname,sectname )
is
.BI \-section " [segname,]sectname"
where the
.I segname
is optional and all segments will be searched for a matching
.IR sectname .
.TP
.B \-t
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the contents of the (\_\^\_TEXT,\_\^\_text) section is to use
the
.BI \-section " \_\^\_TEXT,\_\^\_text"
option.  If disassembly is wanted as with the
.B \-tv
.IR otool (1)
options then the
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-disassemble
is used.  By default
.IR objdump (1)
also symbolically disassembles the operands as the
.IR otool (1)
.B \-tV
options will do.  If this is not wanted then the
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-no-symbolic-operands
option can be used.
.TP
.B \-x
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the contents of every \_\^\_text section defined in a Mach-O
file is
.BI \-section " ,\_\^\_text" .
Note that an empty segment name means all segments. If disassembly is wanted as
with the
.B \-xv
.IR otool (1)
options then
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-disassemble-all
is used.  By default
.IR objdump (1)
also symbolically disassembles the operands as the
.IR otool (1)
.B \-xV
options will do.  If this is not wanted then the
.IR objdump (1)
.B \-no-symbolic-operands
option can be used.
.TP
.B \-d
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the contents of the (\_\^\_DATA,\_\^\_data) section is to use
the
.BI \-section " \_\^\_DATA,\_\^\_data"
option.
.TP
.B \-o
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the contents of the \_\^\_OBJC segment used by the
Objective-C run-time system is
.BR \-objc-meta-data .
.TP
.B \-r
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to display the relocation entries is
.BR \-r .
Note that the default relocation entry format is different between
.IR objdump (1)
and
.IR otool (1).
When
.BR \-r
is combined with the
.BR \-macho
option,
.IR objdump (1)
will display the relocation entries in the classic
.IR otool (1)
format.
.TP
.B \-I

.BR \-link-opt-hints .
.TP
.B \-P
The
.IR objdump (1)
option to print the info plist section, (\_\^\_TEXT,\_\^\_info\_plist), as
strings is
.BR \-info-plist .
.TP

.IR objdump (1)
displaying the disassembled operands symbolically is the default and to get
non-symbolic operands with disassembly the option
.BR \-no-symbolic-operands
is used.

.IR objdump (1)
option to not print leading addresses or headers with disassembly of sections is
.BR \-no-leading-addr .
.TP
.BI \-mcpu= arg
The
.IR objdump (1)
option when doing disassembly using the llvm disassembler to use the cpu
.I arg.
is the same
.BI \-mcpu= arg
option.
.TP
.BI \-arch " arch_type"
The
.IR objdump (1)
options to specifies the architectures to operate on are the same

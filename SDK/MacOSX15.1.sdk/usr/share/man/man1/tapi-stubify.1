.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The stubify command creates a text-based stub file (.tbd) from a dynamic library
or framework.

.PP
When the input is a file, then a text-based stub file is generated next to the
input file with the .tbd file extension (unless the \-o option is used). If the
conversion is not possible, then the tool will abort with an error.

.PP
When the input is a directoy, then the directory is recursively searched for
dynamic library files. All header directories are ignored during that search.
The stubbed files are placed next to the existing dynamic library files.

The existing symbolic link structure is mirrored for the newly created stub
files.

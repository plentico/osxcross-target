 * @param       capabilities NSData containing IOUSBHostCIMessage structures describing capabilities of this IOUSBHostControllerInterface instance
 * @param       queue A serial queue to service asynchronous operations. If nil, a serial queue will be created on behalf of the client.
 * @param       interruptRateHz NSUInteger representing the rate in Hz at which interrupts will be delivered to the kernel driver.
 *              A value ot 0 will send all interrupts to the kernel immediately.
 * @param       commandHandler IOUSBHostControllerInterfaceCommandHandler used to process IOUSBHostCIMessage messages sent by the kernel driver.
 * @param       doorbellHandler IOUSBHostControllerInterfaceDoorbellHandler used to process IOUSBHostCIDoorbell values sent by the kernel driver.
 * @param       interestHandler IOServiceInterestCallback used to process service state changes such as termination. See IOServiceAddInterestNotification
 *              in IOKitLib for more details. All notifications will be serviced on an internal serial queue separate from command and doorbell handlers.
 * @return      An IOUSBHostControllerInterface. The object is to be released by the caller.

/**
 Create a new item.

 The itemTemplate object describes the expected state of the newly created item,
 including its location provided by parentItemIdentifier and filename. The list
 of fields to conside in that object is defined by the fields parameter. Fields
 not listed should be considered as not being defined.

 If the item is a document, the contents should be fetched from provided
 URL. Otherwise url will be nil. If the item is a symbolic link, the target
 path is provided by the symlinkTargetPath of the itemTemplate.

 The system is setting the itemIdentifier of the itemTemplate to a unique value that
 is guaranteed to stay the same for a given item in case the creation is replayed
 after a crash. That itemIdentifier is not intended to be the identifier assigned
 to the item by the provider. In the completion block, the createdItem is expected
 to have its properties matching the values of the item properties with the exception
 of the itemIdentifier which should be the identifier assigned to that item by the
 provider. If the provider reuses an existing identifier, the item that used that
 identifier will be removed from disk, replaced by the createdItem. If the item is
 directory, the two directories will be merged and the items from the existing one
 will be modified with the NSFileProviderModifyItemOptionsItemMayAlreadyExist option set.

 If the provider is not able to apply all the fields at once, it should return a
 set of stillPendingFields in its completion handler. In that case, the system will
 attempt to modify the item later by calling modifyItem with those fields.

 If a field in the returned createdItem does not match the itemTemplate, and is
 not in the list of stillPendingFields, the value from the createdItem will be
 propagated to the disk. If the content of the item as described by createdItem
 does not match the content from url, the provider should set shouldFetchContent
 in the completion handler. The content from the provider will then be fetched
 and propagated to disk.

 In case the NSFileProviderCreateItemOptionsItemMayAlreadyExist option
 is passed, the content may be nil if the item is found by the system without any
 associated content. In that case, you should return a nil item if you are not
 able to match the created item with an existing item from the provider.

 In case of path collision with an already existing item, the provider
 can either fail using -[NSError (NSFileProviderError) fileProviderErrorForCollisionWithItem:]
 or resolve the collision by itself (e.g. by returning an item with a different name).
 If the error is returned, the system will try to resolve the collision by itself by bouncing
 away one of the items (renaming the item).

 If the imported item is refused by the extension, it should return nil for the
 createdItem without any error. In that case, the source item will be deleted
 from disk. If the extension does not wish to synchronise the item, while still
 keeping it on disk, it should still import it locally, but not sync it to its
 server, and return a valid createItem object.

 The progress returned by createItemBasedOnTemplate is expected to include the
 upload progress if any, even if the provider chose to call the completion handler
 before the upload finishes. For example, the provider might decide to call the
 completion handler as soon as the metadata have been stored in a local database.

 Upload errors (such as NSFileProviderErrorInsufficientQuota) should be handled
 with a subsequent update to the item, setting its uploadingError property.
 Upload errors should not prevent creating or importing a document, because they
 can be resolved at a later date (for example, when the user has quota again.)

 Other errors will be presented to the user, but are unexpected.  If you want to
 prevent creation in a given directory, then the directory item's capacities
 should exclude NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsAddingSubItems.

 If the provider is not able to apply all the fields at once, it should return a
 set of stillPendingFields in its completion handler. In that case, the system will

 If a field in the returned item does not match the itemTemplate, and is

 the returned item as described by item does not match the content from url,
 the provider should set shouldFetchContent in the completion handler. The
 content from the provider will then be fetched and propagated to disk.

 If the item modification results from the parent directory being merged into another

 The provider can chose to merge two existing items when receiving modifyItem. In that
 case, the item returned should carry the itemIdentifier of the item with which the
 item will be merged and well as the resulting state of the item. The system will then
 keep one of the items (the one whose itemIdentifier was returned) and remove
 the other one from disk. In case of directories, the content of the two directories

/**
 Called by the system if the set of materialized items changes.

 Materialized items are items that have synced to disk and are not
 dataless.  They may contain a mix of dataless and materialized files and
 directories, but in any case, all their children are represented on disk.
 Traversals of dataless directories by applications trigger an enumeration
 against the file provider extension; traversals of materialized directories
 do not.  It is the responsability of the file provider extension to notify
 the system on remote changes of these files: there is no alternative cache
 invalidation mechanism.

 If the extension doesn't keep track of the materialized set, it will have to
 notify the system of all remote changes.  In that case the working set is the
 entire dataset.  The system may drop items whose parent isn't materialized, to
 avoid unnecessary disk usage.  This saves some I/O, but isn't optimal.  The
 filtering by parentItemIdentifier is better done in the extension;  ideally,
 it would even be done server-side.  A hybrid model is possible, where some
 filtering is done server-side, and some finer filtering is done client-side.

 The file provider extension should therefore keep a list of the identifiers of
 the materialized directories.  This method is called when a new directory is
 materialized or when a materialized directory is rendered dataless.

 To enumerate the set of materialized containers,
 - Call -enumeratorForMaterializedItems on the instance of
   NSFileProviderManager corresponding to your domain;
 - Implement the NSFileProviderEnumerationObserver and
   NSFileProviderChangeObserver on an object;
 - Pass that object to the enumerator;
 - Use the identifiers of items or changes you receive to note the
   materialization status in your database.

 When an item is created, modified or deleted remotely, the file provider
 extension should check whether its parentItemIdentifier is in the materialized
 set.  If it is, the extension needs to inform the system so the system may
 create, modify or delete the file or directory (initially dataless) on disk.
 In the case when an item is reparented, the test should be that either the new
 or the old parentItemIdentifier is in the materialized set.  No need to pretend
 that the iten was deleted if the new parentItemIdentifier is no longer in the
 materialized set: the system will know what to do with an unknown parent
 identifier.

 To notify the system of this created, modified or deleted item,
 - Call -signalEnumeratorForContainerItemIdentifier: on the working set, i.e the
   container identified by NSFileProviderWorkingSetContainerItemIdentifier;
 - Include this item in the next enumeration of the working set.

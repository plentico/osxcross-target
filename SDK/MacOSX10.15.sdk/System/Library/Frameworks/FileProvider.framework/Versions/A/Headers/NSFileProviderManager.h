 The file provider manager allows you to communicate with the file provider

 The file provider framework will invoke your file provider extension in response
 to those calls if appropriate.

 The class also provides methods to manage provider domains. Each domain has a

 were previously managed without a file provider.

 You can use this method in order to migrate from a software that managed a file hierarchy
 on disk to a NSFileProviderExtension without having to redownload the data that was
 already on disk.

 The URL is expected to point to a directory. That directory will be moved away, its
 ownership being taken by the system. From this point, your extension's
 createItemFromTemplate method will be called for every item found in the directory
 with the special NSFileProviderCreateItemOptionsItemMayAlreadyExist option.

 In case a domain with the same name already exists in the file provider manager, the
 call will fail with the code NSFileWriteFileExistsError. The URL will remain untouched.
 In case the system does not allow the extension to request a migration, the call will
 fail with NSFeatureUnsupportedError.

 In case of success, the URL will become invalid and the domain will be created. The
 completion handler is called as soon as the domain is created. Your provider will
 receive calls to createItemBasedOnTemplate afterward.

 When the import of the file hierarchy is finished, the system calls
 -[NSFileProviderExtension signalDidFinishImportingItemsFromDiskWithCompletionHandler:].
 In case -[NSFileProviderManager reimportItemsBelowItemWithIdentifier:completionHandler:]
 is called before the end of the import, a single call to importDidFinishWithCompletionHandler

 This can be called by an extension in case it has lost track of its synchronisation state
 and as a consequence is not able to guarantee the stability of the itemIdentifiers anymore.
 In that case, the system will trigger a scan of any data that is cached on disk and call
 createItemBasedOnTemplate with the special NSFileProviderCreateItemOptionsItemMayAlreadyExist
 option so that the extension can specify the new itemIdentifier for those items. The provided
 item identifier is inclusive, meaning the specified item will be re-import as well as any
 children in case it is a container.

 In case the extension has lost its synchronisation state but is still able to guarantee the
 stability of the itemIdentifiers, it should make sure that querying the working set
 enumerator with an anchor that predates the synchronisation loss will cause a
 NSFileProviderErrorSyncAnchorExpired error.

 In case the extension has lost its synchronisation state and is not interested in preserving
 the data cached on disk, it can remove and re-add the affected domain.

 The completion handler is called immediately and does not reflect the end of the import.
 When the import of the file hierarchy is finished, the system calls
 -[NSFileProviderExtension importDidFinishWithCompletionHandler:].

 If this method succeeds, the system will reimport at least the requested sub-tree, but may
 import more.

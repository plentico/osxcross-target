 File provider domain.

 A file provider domain can be used to represent accounts or different locations
 exposed within a given file provider.

 Domains can be registered to the system using
 @c -[NSFileProviderMananger addDomain:completionHandler:]

 By default, a file provider extension does not have any domain.

 On the extension side, a separate instance of NSFileProviderExtension will be
 created for each @c NSFileProviderDomain registered.  In that case, the
 @c NSFileProviderExtension.domain properties will indicate which domain the
 NSFileProviderExtension belongs to (or nil if none).

 All the files on disk belonging to the same domain must be grouped inside a
 common directory. That directory path is indicated by the
 @p pathRelativeToDocumentStorage property.
